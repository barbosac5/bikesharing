# bikesharing

## Purpose 
The purpose of this activity is to provide more work to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid buisness proposal. In order to solidify this proposal, one of the stakeholders would like to see a complete bike trip analysis. For this chalenge, I used Pandas to change the "tripduration" colum from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, with the new DataFrame I:

  - Showed the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
  
  - SHowed the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for eac hourof each day of the week.
  
  - Showed the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
  
This was done via visualizations with Tableau in order for others to better understand the data I present to them.

## Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
Using Python and Pandas, I converted the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours, minutes, and seconds. After I converted the DataFrame, I exported it as a CSV file to use in Deliverables 2 and 3.

## Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
Using Tableau, I created the following visualizations:
  - How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
  
  - How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
  
  - Provided a breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.
  
This was possible by exporting Deliverable 1 as a CSV file into a new Tableau public workbook.

## Create a Story 
For Deliverable 3, I created a story in Tableau and described the key outcomes of the NYC Citibike analysis for this whole module and in Deliverable 2
